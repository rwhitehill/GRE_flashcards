If an operator $\hat{A}$ has a complete, discrete eigenbasis of states $f_{n}$ then (1) write the decomposition of a wavefunction $\Psi$ in the eigenstates $f_{n}(x)$, (2) write the coefficients of this decomposition, and (3) write the expectation value of the observable $A$ in terms of these coefficients.
